## M40: Linux ABI Compatibility

- [x] Translate Linux x86_64 syscall numbers and semantics (~230 calls: stat/statfs/uname/getdents64/termios layouts, positional I/O, the time calls, sched/credential/capability calls, real `mlock`, `sethostname`, the xattr fd forms).
- [x] Load Linux binaries: static ET_EXEC at its own base, and dynamic ones through their own `PT_INTERP` (a stock Alpine rootfs boots on musl's `ld-musl` — see M94).
- [x] Linux process startup: full auxv (AT_PHDR/BASE/ENTRY/RANDOM/EXECFN/UID…), `arch_prctl`, signal delivery with signo remap, and `rt_sigreturn`.
- [x] Linux-compatible `/proc` and `/sys`: `/proc/<pid>/{environ,statm,limits,cwd,root,mounts}`, `/proc/{swaps,modules,sys/kernel/*,sys/fs/*}`, `/sys/class/net/<if>/*`.
- [x] Detect Linux ELFs through personality (`EI_OSABI` and `NT_GNU_ABI_TAG`).
- [x] `d_ino` is the filesystem's real inode number (ext2/3/4) or the file's stable on-disk identity (FAT/exFAT/ISO first cluster / extent LBA), and `st_ino` reports the same value — readdir and stat now name the same file.
- [x] The privilege and placement calls behave as they claim: capabilities are a real per-task set (a dropped one stays dropped, and root loses the operation it guarded), `setfsuid`/`setfsgid` move the id the VFS checks against (clearing the file-related capabilities as Linux does), `sched_setaffinity` really pins a task, and a `ptrace` tracer that is not the tracee's parent can attach and drive it. `open(2)`'s `O_CREAT` mode is applied (masked by umask) instead of being ignored.
- [x] The rest of the surface, implemented rather than stubbed: `ptrace` (TRACEME/ATTACH/GETREGS/SETREGS/PEEK/POKE/CONT/SINGLESTEP/DETACH/KILL), SysV semaphores (with SEM_UNDO) and message queues (type-selective receive), `chroot` with a real per-task root, runtime `swapon`/`swapoff`, `tee`/`vmsplice`, `ioprio_*`, `name_to_handle_at`/`open_by_handle_at`, `rseq` (live `cpu_id` plus critical-section abort), and legacy `getdents`.

## M29 follow-up: the pthread SMP wedge

- [x] Fixed the long-standing `M29 stress-smp` hang at `-smp 2` (three real races, not one): a futex wake landing while the waiter was momentarily RUNNING was lost; `CLONE_*_SETTID` wrote the child's tid *after* the child could already have exited and had it cleared; and the `CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID` write — which is what releases musl's thread-list lock — could silently fail, leaving the lock owned by a dead thread.
- [x] `filelock_lock` is taken with interrupts disabled; a preempted holder used to deadlock against its own CPU (observed as `SPINLOCK LOCKUP on cpu 0`).
- [x] The watchdog task dump now prints the futex wait queues (key, owner, expected vs current value) and the last thread deaths, which is what made these diagnosable.

## M92: musl libc Port

- [x] Kernel bugfix: fork TLS inheritance.
- [x] Kernel bugfix: `set_thread_area` (NR 205) no-op.

- [x] Full Initramfs Purge: minimal bootstrap without legacy `.inc` headers.
- [x] Ext4 Primary Root Filesystem across all boot modes.
- [x] VFS Disk Node Fixes for ext4 disk nodes.

## M93: Ring 0 Cleanup

- [x] In-Kernel Dynamic Linker Purge: delegated to userspace `ld-musl`.
- [x] Kernel Build Automation Migration: replaced kernel build orchestrator with userspace scripts.

## M94: Foreign Userspace Independence & Kernel Decoupling

- [x] Generic Boot & Init System Orchestration (`init=` cmdline, PID 1 reservation, OpenRC boot).
- [x] Init-Agnostic Runtime Control: FIFOs (RAM + ext2/4 inodes), tmpfs/ramfs/devtmpfs, working `posix_spawn`/`popen`, `flock`. OpenRC boots as PID 1 and `openrc-shutdown` powers off through `/run/openrc/init.ctl` (`iso-openrc` smoke instance); BusyBox init also runs as PID 1. runit/s6 not ported.
- [x] OpenRC -> Dynamic musl Linking (and every other port): `tools/check-dynamic.sh` fails the build on a static executable in the rootfs, exceptions only via `tools/configs/static-allowlist.txt` with a reason. The legacy fixed-base static link path is gone from the cc wrappers, and with it every userspace linker script (`linker.ld`, `linker-cxx.ld`, `linker-libcxx.ld`) — lld's default layout plus `--eh-frame-hdr` keeps `PT_GNU_EH_FRAME`, verified by `CXX-SMOKE: ok exceptions`.
- [x] Standardized Virtual Memory Address Space Layout: no fixed load base left in the build (`userspace/linker.ld` deleted). One boot runs a stock Linux `ET_EXEC` at `0x200000`, b1nix `ET_EXEC` images at `0x2000000` and musl PIEs placed by the loader (randomized under `b1nix.aslr`); the kernel is higher-half, so none of them can collide with it.
- [x] Linux ABI Conformance: every syscall the ported software actually reached (`clock_getres`, `sched_getaffinity`, `faccessat2`, `rt_sigtimedwait`, `statx` with a real dirfd, `sysinfo`, `times`) is translated or implemented — a boot logs no unmapped syscall. **A stock Alpine 3.20 minirootfs boots on b1nix**: its BusyBox init runs as PID 1 through Alpine's own `ld-musl`, its coreutils/awk/sed/pipes work, and `poweroff` shuts the machine down (`tools/try-alpine-rootfs.sh`). runit/s6 remain unported.

## M95: Loadable Kernel Modules — Framework and Device/FS Modules

- [ ] `planned` `module_alloc` and Module Region (`0xFFFFFFFFC0000000` range, W^X).
- [ ] `planned` `struct module` Descriptor and Module List (`load_module`, `delete_module`).
- [ ] `planned` `EXPORT_SYMBOL` Table and Reference Counting (`try_module_get`/`module_put`).
- [ ] `planned` `init_module` / `finit_module` / `delete_module` Syscalls and vermagic.
- [ ] `planned` `/proc/modules` and userspace `modinfo`/`lsmod`/`insmod`/`rmmod`.
- [ ] `planned` Convert Optional Filesystems (`ntfs`, `btrfs`, `isofs`) to `.ko` modules.
- [ ] `planned` Convert Optional Device Drivers (HDA sound driver) to `.ko` modules.
- [ ] `planned` M96 Smoke Test for LKM framework.

## M96: Loadable Kernel Modules — Network Protocols and Module Parameters

- [ ] `planned` Module Dependencies parsing (`depends=`) and `modules.dep`.

## M98: GNU-Free ISO (Limine bootloader + BSD build tools)

See [`docs/gnu-less-plan.md`](gnu-less-plan.md) for the full inventory.

- [x] Bootloader GNU GRUB -> **Limine** (BSD-2-Clause): `tools/mkiso.sh` (Limine + xorriso) replaced `grub-mkrescue` for all nine ISO targets and both in-guest proof harnesses; `boot/limine/limine.conf.in` replaced `boot/grub/grub.cfg`. The disk image gained a side benefit — `limine bios-install` writes the boot stages into the image file, so `mk-disk-image.sh` no longer needs root/losetup/mount.
- [x] Build automation GNU Make -> **bmake** (BSD 3-clause, `/bin/make`) + **samurai** (0BSD Ninja, `/bin/samu`, `/bin/ninja`). `tools/toolchain/build-make.sh` is deleted, `/bin/make` left the static allowlist, and `tools/inguest/Makefile` is now portable BSD make. Verified in-guest by `M98-SMOKE`.
- [x] GNU Wget -> curl / BusyBox wget (done earlier; `/bin/wget` is the BusyBox applet).
- [x] Shell GNU bash -> **zsh** (MIT-like) as `/bin/zsh`, the login shell in `/etc/passwd`, with BusyBox `ash` as `/bin/sh`. zsh needs a terminal library, which b1nix never had (bash carried its own bundled termcap), so **netbsd-curses** (BSD) was ported alongside it. `tools/ports/build-bash.sh` is deleted and the packaged bash is purged from the rootfs by `install-ports.sh`. Verified by `ZSH-SMOKE` (12 checks, the same feature surface `BASH-SMOKE` covered).
- [x] Gnulib left the tree with bash — it was only ever bundled inside it.

**The shipped ISO is now GNU-free**: bootloader, shell, build tools, downloader, libc, C++ runtime and toolchain all carry BSD/MIT/Apache/0BSD licences.
